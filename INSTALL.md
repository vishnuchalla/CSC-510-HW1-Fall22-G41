You will need Python in your system to run the code, before downloading the code, make sure you have Python installed in your system.

### Installing Python for Mac
1. Download an installer package from the Python website. To do that, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ on your Mac; it detects your operating system automatically and shows a big button for downloading the latest version of Python installer on your Mac. If it doesn’t, click the macOS link and choose the latest Python release.
2. Once the download is complete, double-click the package to start installing Python. You may also have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python.
3. To verify that the latest version of Python and IDLE is installed correctly, double-click IDLE, which is the integrated development environment shipped with Python. 

### Installing Python for Windows

2. Click on the link to download Windows x86 executable installer if you are using a 32-bit installer. In case if you are using a 64-bit installer, then download Windows x86-64 executable installer.
3. Once the installer is downloaded, run the Python installer.
4. Check the Install launcher for all users check box. Also, check the Python to path check box to include the interpreter in the execution path.

- $ sudo apt-get update
- $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
2. If you are using another version of Ubuntu or you want to use a more current Python, use https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa to install Python 3.8:
- $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
- $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
- $ sudo apt-get update
- $ sudo apt-get install python3.8
3. If you are using other Linux distribution, chances are you already have Python 3 pre-installed as well. If not, use your distribution's package manager.
